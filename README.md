# 🎵 From Tracks to Trends: Analyzing Music Listening Behavior

## 📌 Introduction
This project analyzes music streaming data to uncover listening behavior patterns across two cities.  
The objective is to determine whether user activity differs by **city** and by **day of the week**, transforming raw data into actionable insights.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset (`music_project_en.csv`) contains user listening activity with the following columns:

- **userID** – unique identifier for each user  
- **Track** – song title  
- **artist** – artist name  
- **genre** – music genre  
- **City** – user’s city  
- **time** – time of playback (HH:MM:SS)  
- **Day** – day of the week  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
The analysis follows three main stages:

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Overview of dataset structure and descriptive statistics  
   - Initial observations of user activity  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning column names  
   - Handling missing values and duplicates  
   - Preparing data for analysis  

3. **Analysis & Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Investigating music activity across weekdays and cities  
   - Comparing listening trends between groups  
   - Visualizing results with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**  

---

## 📊 Results
- Identified user listening trends by **city** and **day of the week**  
- Confirmed/Rejected hypotheses about user behavior differences  
- Generated visualizations to support findings  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The project demonstrates proficiency in:  
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)**  
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Hypothesis testing** for behavioral insights  

These results provide a data-driven perspective on how listening habits vary across different urban contexts and timeframes.
